With OpenFaas installed and setup, you are now ready to write and deploy your first serverless functions to Kubernetes!
While it is possible to create and deploy functions through the UI, we will do it through the faas-cli.

## Generate function from template
You start by creating a serverless function using Node.js: `faas-cli new hello --lang node`{{execute}}. 

This will create a new function from a OpenFaas template, that is stored in git repositories. The following files will be created:
- hello.yml: Information on how OpenFaas should build and deploy your function(s).
- hello/handler.js: contains your function
- hello/requirement.txt: can be used to add additional dependencies to be used by the functions

Open the IDE tab. You should be able to see the files mentioned above. The handler.js in the directory ```/hello```  will look like this:
```
"use strict"

module.exports = async (context, callback) => {
    return {status: "done"}
}
```
It is a serverless function which returns a JSON object with the status set to "done" every time it is called.
Let's replace the returned object with the following:

```
return {message: "https://imgflip.com/i/6cxwt9"}
```
You can modify it to do whatever you want. ðŸ˜Š
