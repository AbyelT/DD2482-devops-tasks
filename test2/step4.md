To access the UI, you need to first obtain the password that is auto-generated by openFaas. Echo it in terminal to see the password:
- `PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n openfaas basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode; echo)`{{execute}}
- `echo $PASSWORD`{{execute}}
Copy the password before moving on.

To access the UI, open a new tab in the terminal (the + sign beside the terminal) and select **View HTTP port 80 on Host 1**. This leads to a new page for connecting to ports, the default port for openFaas UI is **31112**. This is the Kubernetes NodePort of the external-gateway OpenFaaS service. Input the port number at the textbox and click *display port*

A pop-up will then appear which requires your credentials. Authorize using the username *admin* and the password as the copied value from the echo. 

If correct, The OpenFaas UI should appear similar like this:

With OpenFaas installed and setup, you are now ready to write your first serverless functions and deploy them to kubernetes!
