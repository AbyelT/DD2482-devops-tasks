OpenFaas automatically handles scaling by changing the amount of replicas in kubernetes with your function(s). When your functions receive more traffic than they can handle, OpenFaas will add more replicas to balance the amount traffic per replica. When the traffic decreases, the amount of replicas also decreases. 
 OpenFaaS is configured such that it will auto-scale based upon the *request per seconds metric* as measured through Prometheus.
The default minimun amount of replicas we have is *1* and the maximun amout of replicas is *20*. We can change them by setting *com.openfaas.scale.min* and *com.openfaas.scale.max*.
